# PowerBI-Project-4
Developed an interactive dashboard to analyze and visualize flight pricing trends based on factors like airline, source, destination, departure time, and travel duration. Identified key patterns influencing ticket prices and provided insights to support predictive modeling and decision-making.
Project: Airline Price Prediction Analysis (Power BI)

This Power BI dashboard analyzes how airline ticket prices vary based on multiple factors such as airline, booking time, departure and arrival time, route, and travel class.
The analysis helps identify price patterns and customer booking behavior.
Key insights show that last-minute bookings (1–2 days before departure) are more expensive, business class costs much higher than economy, and morning/evening flights or busy routes (like Delhi–Mumbai) generally have higher average fares.
These findings support better pricing, marketing, and demand planning decisions for airlines.
